Banking institutions can better leverage funds deposited if they are confident the
funds will remain in the account longer than traditional deposit accounts. This study
seeks to isolate the best performing model to predict whether a client will subscribe
to a bank term deposit as a result of a telemarketing campaign. The insights from this
study can also lead to an increase in success in future campaigns by indicating the
most important predictors. For this study, ANN setting (4), (2), Random Forest, and
SVM with RBF kernel have the highest overall performance when predicting whether
a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit. To evaluate the success of our model,
we considered various alternative metrics rather than accuracy alone, due to the
unbalanced nature of the data. The alternative metrics considered included kappa
score, precision, and balanced accuracy. When comparing our models that employed
balancing techniques, we saw an increase in performance for balanced accuracy,
kappa scores, and specificity. The most significant predictors were previous outcome,
month, age, and contact. These predictors may indicate that the characteristics of the
telemarketing campaign are important to consider and may explain a large portion of
the overall success of a campaign.
